[Hello World!]

Author : PLOYART Gregory aka lyl-Lynx

This program was meant to show how I can manipulate Python, Qt UI, SQL database and queries. 

In the "Location Data Browser" folder, you can find an .exe file that execute my application.
Another way is to use your IDE to launch the program with the .py files.

This application is composed of two tabs : "List of countries" and "Search Location".

"List of countries" asks you to select a continent within those in the comboBox 
then displays a QTableWidget with all the countries that are part of the selected continent.

"Search Location" asks you to select at least a country in order to return some basic data (Continent, Country, Capital City).
